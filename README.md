# Salesforce Boat Rent App - Redefined

This app is build based on Trailhead Lightning Web Components Specialist task.  
I wrote the first version of this app while doing LWC Superbadge in February'21.  
The task validation required a particular way of writing code, which I didn't like.  
Therefore, I rewrote the application in my own way, using tools I like.  
This version of app <u>**won't**</u> pass LWC Superbadge tasks.
